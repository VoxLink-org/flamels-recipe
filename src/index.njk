  title: Frequently asked questions
  entries:
    - question: Is Pages CMS free?
      answer: Yes, Pages CMS is 100% free, whether you want to use [the online
        version](https://app.pagescms.org), deploy it for free on
        [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or self-host it. It's MIT licensed
        through and through, feel free to extend it as you see fit.
    - question: Do you only support GitHub?
      answer: "Yes. Supposedly, we could add GitLab and Bitbucket support, but the
        assumption is the vast majority of users will be on GitHub. Pull
        requests and issues are welcome:
        [github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms](https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms\
        )."
    - question: Why yet another CMS?
      answer: I hear you, but I needed Pages CMS to exist. I love static site
        generators, and while YAML front matter and Markdown aren't terribly
        complicated, editing content and uploading images using GitHub.com or
        Git isn't really user-friendly, especially if you're updating the site
        with a whole team. For that reason, a lot of teams use a headless CMS
        like Contentful, Sanity, or Strapi. That works, but it's one more
        dependency and is overkill in most cases. You could also use something
        like Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS). Really cool project, but I've
        never been a fan of the user experience. And most importantly, I wanted
        something as simple as possible. Back in 2018, I had built a lightweight
        CMS ([Jekyll+](https://github.com/hunvreus/jekyllplus)) with the idea of
        getting the CMS set up with a single configuration file. Pages CMS is
        the next iteration of that idea.
    - question: Who made this? It sucks!
      answer: "I did: [Ronan Berder](https://ronanberder.com)
        ([@hunvreus](https://x.com/hunvreus)). I'm a half-decent developer, but
        I sure could use some help to make this suck less:
        [github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms](https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms\
        )."
