*Date: Mon Aug 18 2025*

## 1. Executive Summary  

| Aspect | View |
|--------|------|
| **Fundamentals** | Valuation appears cheap relative to peers (Trailing P/E ≈ 7.4 vs industry ≈ 11). Profitability is modest but improving (ROE ≈ 17 %). Cash flow turned positive in 2024, but debt remains moderate (Debt/Equity ≈ 43 %). |
| **Technicals** | Short‑term moving averages (7‑day > 30‑day) are slightly bullish, but momentum indicators (MACD, ADX, OBV) show weakening trend. The price sits near a **Fibonacci‑based support zone** ($30.96‑$30.47). |
| **Smart‑Money / Sentiment** | (Not requested – no strong insider buying or short‑interest spikes observed in recent filings). |
| **Recommendation** | **Neutral‑to‑slightly‑bullish** – the stock is undervalued and the recent earnings beat suggests upside potential, but the technical picture is mixed. A disciplined entry around $30.5 with a modest target ($35) and a stop at $29.5 is appropriate. |

> **Back‑testing order placed** – see the “Order” section at the end of the report.

## 2. Fundamental Analysis  

### 2.1 Valuation Multiples  

| Metric | AA | Industry Avg* |
|--------|----|---------------|
| Trailing P/E | **7.38** | 11.22 |
| Forward P/E | **9.80** | 10.37 |
| Price/Book | **1.32** | 1.60 |
| EV/EBITDA | **4.26** | 6.5 |
| Price/Sales | **0.62** | 1.2 |

*Industry benchmarks are based on the broader aluminum & mining peer group (e.g., Rio Tinto, Rusal, Norsk Hydro).  

**Interpretation:**  
- AA trades at a **significant discount** on most multiples, suggesting a potential value opportunity.  
- The low P/E is supported by solid earnings (EPS ≈ $4.24 FY‑2024) and a healthy profit margin (≈ 7.9 %).  

### 2.2 Profitability  

- **Net Income (FY‑2024):** $989 M (up from a loss in 2023).  
- **Return on Equity:** 17.15 % (well above the industry median ~10 %).  
- **Profit Margin:** 7.86 % – modest, but stable after a recent trough.  

### 2.3 Cash Flow & Balance Sheet  

| Item | FY‑2024 |
|------|----------|
| Operating Cash Flow | **$622 M** |
| Free Cash Flow | **+$42 M** |
| Total Cash | $1.51 B |
| Total Debt | $2.8 B |
| Debt/Equity | 42.6 % |
| Interest Coverage (EBIT/Int.) | ≈ 5.0× |

**Interpretation:**  
- Positive free cash flow signals that the company is generating cash after cap‑ex.  
- Debt levels are **manageable**; the debt‑to‑equity ratio is below many peers, though leverage should be monitored.  

### 2.4 Recent Earnings Highlights  

| Quarter | EPS (Reported) | EPS (Est.) | Surprise |
|---------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| Q1 2025 | $2.15 | $1.41 | **+53 %** |
| Q3 2024 | $0.57 | $0.30 | **+90 %** |
| Q2 2025 | $0.39 | $0.39 | **in‑line** |

- The company **beat** expectations in two of the last three quarters, driven by higher aluminum prices and cost‑control.  
- Q2 2025 EPS was flat to estimates, indicating that the recent upside may be moderating.

### 3.3 Momentum & Volatility Indicators  

| Indicator | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **RSI (14)** | 56.8 | Neutral (neither overbought nor oversold) |
| **Stochastic %K / %D** | 88 / 85 | Overbought – possible short‑term pull‑back |
| **MACD** | +0.34 (histogram negative) | Weak downward momentum |
| **ADX** | 10.7 | Trend is weak (no clear direction) |
| **OBV** | Declining | Selling pressure accumulating |

### 3.4 Candlestick Patterns (last 60 days)  

- **Hammer** on 11 Jul 2025 – bullish reversal potential.  
- **Evening Star** on 25 Jun 2025 – bearish reversal.

## 4. Risk Factors  

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Commodity price volatility** – Aluminum prices can swing sharply with global demand, supply disruptions, or tariff changes (e.g., US Section 232). |
| **Regulatory/tariff risk** – Potential new import duties on aluminum could squeeze margins. |
| **Leverage** – While debt is moderate, any sharp earnings deterioration could stress debt‑service capacity. |
| **Technical downside** – If price falls below $30.0, the next support is around $29.7 (61.8 % Fib) and then $28.4; a breach could trigger larger losses. |

---

## 5. Investment Thesis & Target  

1. **Valuation upside:** Current multiples suggest 15‑25 % upside to bring the price toward a **target of $35** (≈ 13 % above current price).  
2. **Earnings momentum:** Recent beat‑and‑meet earnings indicate the company can deliver cash flow even in a volatile commodity environment.  
3. **Technical entry zone:** Buying near the **$30.5–$31.0** range aligns with the short‑term support zone and offers a decent risk‑reward (target $35, stop $29.5).  

**Conclusion:** The stock is **moderately attractive** for a value‑oriented investor comfortable with commodity exposure and willing to monitor technical cues.
